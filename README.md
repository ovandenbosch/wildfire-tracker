## Features :fire:
- This project is hosted on [Vercel,](https://vercel.com) a free hosting platfrom that I would recommend to everyone
- Ability to drag around the map
- Zoom in and out
- Click on an individual wildfire to display more information
- Very quick and responsive UI
## Tech Stack ðŸ¥ž
This project was created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a very popular [React](https://react.org) framework. The map itself is part of the [Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps), which easily allows you to add maps to your application. Also, the data used to determine where the wildfires are is from [The Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker](https://api.nasa.gov/), an open NASA API.

## Installation ðŸ”®
If you would like to reproduce this project locally, first make sure you have npm and node installed, then continue with the following commands

### Clone the Project

git clone https://github.com/ovandenbosch/wildfire-tracker

cd wildfire-tracker

### Install Dependencies
